If she works 30 weeks a year, 20 hours a week as a teacher and 30 hours a week as a coach, what's her annual salary?","First find the total amount Jill makes per week teaching: $16814/hour * 20 hours/week = $<<16814*20=336280>>336280/week
Then find the total amount Jill makes per week coaching: $11396/hour * 30 hours/week = $<<11396*30=341880>>341880/week
Then add those two amounts to find the total amount Jill makes per week: $336280/week + $341880/week = $<<336280+341880=678160>>678160/week
Then multiply that number by the number of weeks Jill works in a year to find her annual salary: $678160/week * 30 weeks/year = $<<678160*30=20344800>>20344800
