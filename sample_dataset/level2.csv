25,John has 9 boxes. Each box is 710 inches by 3 inches by 8 inches. The walls are 1 inch thick. What is the total inner volume of all 9 boxes?,"The walls subtract 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 inches from each dimension.
So each box has 710-2=<<710-2=708>>708 inch width.
It also has a 3-2=<<3-2=1>>1 inch height.
Finally, it has a 8-2=<<8-2=6>>6 inch depth.

So in total the inner volume of the 9 boxes is 9*4248=<<9*4248=38232>>38232 cubic inches.
